    "text": "Adult learners (above age 25 years) are a diverse group of individuals that account for 23% of the undergraduate student population (National Center for Educational Statistics, 2022).\nSeveral barriers to learning and academic achievement for adult learners include financial concerns, technology use concerns, time-management concerns, and general feelings of being underprepared for college-level learning (Bellaire et al., 2023).\nMicro credential programs are short, credential-based programs that are designed to provide in-demand skills, training, and experience in an area of community need. Direct Support Professionals (DSPs) support individuals with disabilities across several contexts and within a variety of daily living settings.\nThe State University of New York DSP Program, in partnership with New York Stateâ€™s Office for People with Developmental Disabilities and the National Alliance for Direct Support Professionals (NADSP), provides direct support professionals with training that leads to national certification in the skills and competency areas unique to the field of direct support."

    "text": "Conclusion\n\nMicro credential programs are a promising avenue to promote adult learner success at the college-level.\nThese programs have become particularly beneficial in fostering pathways for professional development and career advancement in high demand but traditionally under supported fields of human services such as direct support.\nThese data are a crucial first step in providing instructors and administrators empirically based best practices for successfully supporting adult learners in micro credential programs.\nFuture work should examine which aspects of the program support model were most effective in reducing barriers to program completion and promoting student success (e.g., 1) financial support for program tuition, fees, and textbook costs, 2) program-specific academic coaches, 3) a cash incentive for program completion, and 4) additional hardship funding to cover costs associated with childcare, travel, technology, or other prohibitive costs).\n\n\nPoster"
